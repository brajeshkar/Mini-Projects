How to use this project file? -- We need to run the .cpp file and rest processing will proceed on it's own.

More details below:-
1.The project contains 30 recorded samples for each vowel.
2.First 20 samples of each vowel is used for training the model.
3.Remaining 10 samples of each vowel is used for testing(vowel recognition test).
4.Run the program and it will train the model with first 20 samples for each vowel
5.And, then it will test the remaining samples of each vowel and predict the vowel.
